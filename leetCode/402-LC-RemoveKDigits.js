/**
 * Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits
 * from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
 * Output: "1219"
 * Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219
 * which is the smallest.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: num = "10200", k = 1
 * Output: "200"
 * Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: num = "10", k = 2
 * Output: "0"
 * Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
 *
 * Note:
 * The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
 * The given num does not contain any leading zero.

/**
 * Notes:
 * The first loop will only work on elements with a peak in the middle. The reason
 * is because if the last element in the stack is smaller than the digit we just push.
 *
 * With Peak:
 * "132"
 *
 *    x
 *    |
 *  3 |      *
 *    |     /  \
 *  2 |    /    *
 *    |   /
 *  1 |  *
 *    |
 *    *____________ y
 *       1   2   3
 *
 * Without a peak:
 * "123"
 *    x
 *    |
 *  3 |       *
 *    |      /
 *  2 |     *
 *    |    /
 *  1 |   *
 *    |
 *    *__________ y
 *       1  2  3
 *
 * A number without a peak is always in ascending order. And given an ascending
 * number we can just pop the values from right to left. This will be handled on
 * the second loop.
